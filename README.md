# `listbox`

Repository for [`with-heart`'s](https://github.com/with-heart) "accessible
listbox" stream. We'll be recreating the
[WAI-ARIA 1.2 Scrollable Listbox Example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/examples/listbox/listbox-scrollable.html)
using React and a few libraries.

Catch the stream here: https://twitch.tv/with_heart
